# MCP Server Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Technology Decision
- Define MCP server requirements and scope
- Plan API endpoint structure and data models
- [x] Choose technology stack (FastAPI, MCP SDK, Python, Database)
  - [x] Programming language: Python
  - [x] SDK: mcp
  - [x] Database: No db, only flat files with an organised folder structure

## Phase 2: Design Phase
- Design flashcard data model (id, user_id, front/back content, language, timestamps)
- Design practice session data model (session_id, user_id, flashcard_ids, status, timestamps)
- Design API endpoint structure and HTTP methods
- Plan database schema and relationships
- Define error handling and logging requirements

## Phase 3: Implementation
- Set up development environment and dependencies
- Create project directory structure
- Implement MCP application framework
- Implement flashcard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Implement practice session management (Create, Read, Complete)
- Add authentication and security measures
- Implement error handling and logging system
- Configure CORS settings for frontend integration

## Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- Write unit tests for all endpoints
- Create integration tests for complete workflows
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Validate API responses and data integrity
- Verify MCP protocol compliance
- Test integration with LLM tutor

## Phase 5: Documentation and Examples (Optional)
- Create API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Write usage examples for LLM integration
- Document endpoint parameters and response formats
- Provide sample requests for different operations
