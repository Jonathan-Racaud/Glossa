# MCP Server Development Plan

## Phase 1: Requirements Gathering and Technology Decision

### Project Scope and Main Functionality
- Primary focus: Flashcard management system with CRUD operations
- Secondary consideration: Practice sessions with spaced repetition algorithm (deferred to later phases)
- Portfolio project with no constraints or limitations
- Will be used by external AI systems (MCP protocol compliance)

### API Endpoint Structure
- Main operations: CRUD for flashcards
- Special read operation: Retrieve front of card for practice mode
- Simple architecture with monolithic design

### Technology Stack
- Programming language: Python
- Framework: FastAPI
- SDK: MCP SDK for server implementation
- Database: Flat files instead of database (simplified deployment)
- Latest available versions of all technologies

### Data Models
#### Flashcard Model
- Basic fields: id, user_id, front/back content, language, timestamps
- Additional fields: image and audio support for enhanced retention
- Simple structure to minimize complexity

#### Practice Session Model
- Simple design for now: session_id, user_id, flashcard_ids, status, timestamps
- Will be expanded in later phases with spaced repetition logic

### System Architecture
- Monolithic architecture for simplicity and small scope
- No authentication or security needed at this stage
- External AI integration via MCP protocol
- Deployment considerations: Easy sharing of flashcards as plain text files
